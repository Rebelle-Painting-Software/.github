## What is Rebelle?

**Rebelle** is an award-winning, realistic painting software developed to provide artists with the most authentic traditional painting experience in a digital environment. Unlike standard digital art applications that use generic brushes and filters, Rebelle utilizes advanced physics-based algorithms to simulate real-world painting materials and techniques with unprecedented accuracy.

With Rebelle, digital artists can experience true-to-life watercolor diffusion where pigments flow and blend naturally on wet paper, exactly like their physical counterparts. The software meticulously replicates the behavior of watercolors, acrylics, oils, ink, and various dry media through sophisticated simulation of gravity, pigment density, water volume, and paper texture absorption. Every brushstroke responds to canvas tilt, pressure sensitivity, and drying time, creating organic artistic effects that were previously impossible to achieve digitally.

Artists worldwide praise Rebelle for its ability to bridge the gap between traditional and digital art, offering the convenience of digital workflow while maintaining the spontaneous, unpredictable beauty of physical media. Whether you're creating delicate watercolor landscapes, bold acrylic compositions, or detailed ink illustrations, Rebelle provides the tools and responsiveness that serious artists demand.
